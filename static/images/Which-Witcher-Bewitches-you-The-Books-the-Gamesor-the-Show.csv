1819,Geralt of Rivia,"Think Geralt of Rivia, an image of a ripped Henry Cavill with silver hair and deep golden eyes looking at you is what you can think of, then here’s something you ought to know. Sapkowski’s books, CD Projekt Red’s game, and Netflix’s version have different renditions of the badass monster hunter.

<b><br>Geralt from the books</b>
<br>Gear up for the disappointment that’s coming your way! In the books, Geralt envisioned by Sapkowski as nothing like the drool-worthy Netflix character or the formidable hero in the game. He’s described as skinny with pale white hair and skin. Geralt’s scars in the Netflix show give him a mysterious demeanor, but his heavily scarred appearance in the book is a tad bit unsettling. The only similarity shared between the two Geralts is that they don’t sport beards. The book’s Geralt carries two swords, one on his back and one on his hip, is emotionally vulnerable, fierce, has dark eyes, and an ugly smile. He wears a nondescript wolf medallion and is realistically powerful, unlike the video game hunk who’s superhuman strength is quite overwhelming.",publish,Entertainment - TV & Film,Entertainment,"Which Witcher Bewitches you?
