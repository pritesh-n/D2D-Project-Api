2820,Bruce Springsteen,"Can’t believe it was ages ago that Bruce Springsteen shimmied on stage with Courtney Cox for his song “Dancing in the Dark”!

2822,Phoebe Bridgers,"She has been on a roller coaster ride since her debut album <i>Stranger in the Alps</i>, which was released in 2017. She then worked with Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus, who are a part of Boygenius, in 2018. Then came her collab with Conor Oberst for the band <i>Better Oblivion Community Center</i> in 2019.

2824,Justin Bieber,"It’s been nearly five years since we got a Bieber album after Purpose. The artist who became an instant hit with the candy-floss song “Baby” apparently decided to take a hiatus from music. But he has kept his Beliebers’ appetites whetted with frequent collaborations. We have seen him feature on the uber-popular dance hit “Despacito”. He has also been doing collabs and remixes with Ed Sheeran, Billie Eilish, and DJ Khaled. Still, it is time we get a full-fledged album from him. Seems like 2020 is the year of the Bieber album. Going by the lead single “Yummy”, we are guessing the new album will have ummm…quite yummy vibes too.",publish,Music,Entertainment,30 Most Anticipated Albums of 2020,"New Year, new jam! 2020 is here and it seems like it’s the year of fabulous music.

2826,Childish Gambino,"He had us shook with his single “This is America.” The song was so polarizing that the pop culture of 2018 is still reeling under it. Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, has multiple accomplishments to his name, the most notable among these being his Childish Gambino project.

7021,Adele,"She made a grand re-entrance into the music scene by setting fire to the rain. Then she had us rolling in the deep. Then she said sorry for breaking our hearts when she said hello from the other side. You get the picture now? So, you can imagine us jumping with glee when the artist announced on Instagram last year: “Bunch of f****** savages, 30 will be a drum n bass record to spite you.” While that might’ve been an exaggeration, what isn’t is our excitement.",publish,Music,Entertainment,30 Most Anticipated Albums of 2020,"New Year, new jam! 2020 is here and it seems like it’s the year of fabulous music.
