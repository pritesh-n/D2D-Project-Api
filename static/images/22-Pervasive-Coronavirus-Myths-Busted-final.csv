"Myth: Pneumonia vaccine to your rescue
","Many are discussing the benefits of medications like the pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccines against the new coronavirus. The discussion stems from the possibility that these viral vaccines are effective against viruses in general and that something is better than nothing.

"Truth: Pneumonia vaccines work just against pneumonia
","Numerous theories have been floating, and one of them is the possibility of other viral vaccines preventing the disease. Although the existing vaccines protect against specific respiratory illnesses, this is a new virus that needs a new vaccine.

"Myth: Summer is your friend against the coronavirus
","Another rampant myth making the rounds is that the novel coronavirus cannot survive in high temperatures. This has also led people to believe that come spring, the world will be able to breathe a sigh of relief as the virus will be less dangerous in certain regions, at the very least.

"
"Truth: Coronavirus is not affected by environmental temperatures
","This myth presumably stemmed from the fact that a lot of microbes can be killed at high temperatures, but these temperatures are much higher than those during summers. Granted that certain viruses, like the flu virus, are less prevalent during warm weather, the same cannot be said for the new coronavirus. Current evidence suggests that the disease is equally prevalent in countries like Australia and Singapore, and nothing points to a seasonal rise in temperature working against its spread.

"Truth: Or maybe not!
","While mosquitoes are responsible for the transmission of malaria, there has been no evidence of them partaking in the spread of the new coronavirus disease. It is a respiratory disease, and mosquitoes can only transmit diseases by transferring infected blood from one person to another. The coronavirus disease spreads through droplets that escape an infected person’s mouth when they cough or sneeze, so cover your nose and mouth and maintain a safe distance from people.

","Although thermal scanners make the screening process easier, they only detect symptomatic patients of the disease.

This is because a person might take 2 to 10 days to develop any symptoms after being infected.

","Nasal lavage is the process of passing warm saline water through the nasal passage to clear out congestion, rid it of microbial growth, and maintain hygiene.
