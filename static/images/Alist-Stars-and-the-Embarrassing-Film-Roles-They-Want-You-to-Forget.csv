2942,Zac Efron as Matt Brody in <i>Baywatch</i> (2017),"Just like the series, <i>Baywatch</i> follows the lives of lifeguards as they uncover a deadly criminal plot. <b>Why is this embarrassing?</b> The main issue of casting Zac Effron in <i>Baywatch</i> was that he was used as a poster boy rather than having his amazing acting skills put to use. The movie’s 17% approval ratings are a testament to this shoddy remake of the original series.",draft,Entertainment - TV & Film,Gallery,A-list Stars and the Embarrassing Film Roles They Want You to Forget,"Any aspect of a movie can leave people and critics unimpressed, be it bad casting choices, poor production and direction, or even shoddy screenplay and performances. Some of the greatest actors in Hollywood have found themselves associated with some unforgivingly terrible films. Even the oscar-winning Brad Pitt and <i>a La Land’s</i> Emma Stone are no exceptions to such lapses in judgment.

2944,Idris Elba as Macavity in Cats (2019),"It’s about cats. That’s it. <b>Why is this embarrassing?</b> The Critics Consensus on Rotten Tomatoes for the movie is, “Despite its fur-midable cast, this <i>Cats</i> adaptation is a clawful mistake that will leave most viewers begging to be put out of their mew-sery.” Let’s not forget the horrible animation that could give you nightmares for years? The broadway show brought to the big screen is definitely one of the worst decisions of the decade and we’re talking worse than when people ate tide pods on the Internet.",publish,Entertainment - TV & Film,Gallery,A-list Stars and the Embarrassing Film Roles They Want You to Forget,"Any aspect of a movie can leave people and critics unimpressed, be it bad casting choices, poor production and direction, or even shoddy screenplay and performances.

5719,Octavia Spencer as Madame Nora in Dinner for Schmucks (2010),"The movie follows up-and-coming executive Tim, who brings along Barry to a party where the hosts compete to see whose guest is the dumbest. <b>Why is this embarrassing?</b> Octavia Spencer is an award-winning actress and a comedy queen. This movie is a waste of her immense talents by casting her as a pet psychic who channels the spirit of a dead lobster. Boy, aren't we grateful that she was cast in <i>The Help</i>?!",publish,Entertainment - TV & Film,Gallery,A-list Stars and the Embarrassing Film Roles They Want You to Forget,"Any aspect of a movie can leave people and critics unimpressed, be it bad casting choices, poor production and direction, or even shoddy screenplay and performances.
