Older adults,"Adults in the age groups of 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80+ have been observed to be most susceptible to COVID-19. Also, the virus has proven to be fatal to those who are in the age groups of 60-69, 70-79, and above. According to the CDC, nearly 31% to 59% of those above the age of 65 years will need hospitalization, in case they are diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these, about 11% to 31% will require intensive care.",Draft,Health,Gallery,Not Considering Social Isolation?

COVID-19 is a new strain of the coronavirus. The CDC, WHO, medical experts, researchers, and everyone, in general, are still learning about the impact of the virus. The worrisome part is that there is currently no treatment or vaccine to protect against COVID-19 infection.

This is why all the advisories from the CDC, WHO, and governments across the world are recommending everyone to stay at home and practice social isolation. The only way right now to prevent the rise of COVID-19 cases is by flattening the curve. 
Not too keen about socially isolating yourself? Here’s what you need to know. Even if you do not experience COVID-19 symptoms, you might be a carrier of the virus. Or worse, you could be a super-spreader. No, this does not mean you’re like Superman, and you most definitely should not be proud of this label. You know why?

What makes older adults vulnerable?,"The symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to the flu. In the case of older adults, these symptoms may become more severe. When this happens, complications like pneumonia will develop. Once they develop these complications, it will be extremely difficult for them to fight the disease off.

Pregnant women,"There has been no substantial evidence yet to know if pregnant women are vulnerable to COVID-19 or if they will have more serious illnesses as a result of the virus. At this time, it is not known if the virus will cause any complications during pregnancy. This also means that there is no information if the mother will pass on the virus to the fetus or baby during delivery. Although there have been a few cases of complications during delivery, it hasn’t been determined if it is because of the virus. Infants born to mothers with COVID-19 have not yet tested positive. Moreover, no traces of the virus have been found in the samples of breast milk and amniotic acid taken from the mother.

Why are pregnant women at risk?,"Women go through a lot of physical changes during pregnancy. Their hormone levels change and immunity levels are affected. All these factors make them vulnerable to a number of infections, including this virus. The novel coronavirus belongs to the same family of viruses that cause influenza and other viral respiratory infections. Pregnant women have been observed to be at a higher risk of contracting severe illnesses due to these viral infections.

Why are those with respiratory diseases likely to be affected by this virus?,"COVID-19 affects the lungs, throat, and airways. Its symptoms include shortness of breath and dry cough. These symptoms are similar to the flu and common cold. The virus is known to be present in the upper respiratory tract, which means that it essentially affects the respiratory system. The lining of the respiratory tract gets injured, causing inflammation. If this occurs, even a spec of dust can give rise to severe bouts of coughing. This, in turn, causes an outpouring of material that is inflammatory into the lungs and air sacs. This can lead to pneumonia. People with underlying respiratory disorders already have a weak respiratory system. COVID-19 infection may aggravate their pre-existing disorder leading to severe complications.",Draft,Health,Gallery,Not Considering Social Isolation?

People who are immunocompromised,"People who are undergoing chemotherapy generally have a weakened immune system. If a person is being given medications that involve steroids, they will also be immunocompromised. HIV (especially those not on antiretroviral therapy or ART), AIDS, hepatitis, multiple sclerosis, lupus, and various other autoimmune disorders cause the immune system to become weak.

Why is a weak immune system a risk factor for COVID-19?,"Those with autoimmune disorders such as HIV are at a high risk of getting very sick. Based on their age and other pre-existing medical conditions, such persons may experience severe complications if they become infected with COVID-19. They are likely to be placed on ventilators and hospitalized as their immune system is not strong enough to fight the disease.
