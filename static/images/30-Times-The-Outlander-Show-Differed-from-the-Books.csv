3204,The books show more of time travel and explains it better,"<b>In the books:</b> The historically accurate series is not only for history buffs but also appeals to sci-fi lovers as it focuses on Claire traveling through time. The entire concept of time travel is deeply inserted into the story, and the books also show how some of Claire’s friends and enemies are time travelers as well.

3206,The books bring history to life,"<b>In the books:</b> The <i>Outlander</i> books are a great nod to the history of Scotland. The entire premise of the story is sewn into historical facts, which bring the past to life and make the books so much more interesting to read.

Any reader can testify to the number of intimate moments Claire and Jamie share throughout the books. All of which are epic in nature! 
 <b>On the show:</b> The show has its moments, actually, it has a lot of moments (which we all secretly love) but it’s way “less” intimate than the books.

3210,The books rightly portray how difficult and complex love can be,"<b>In the books:</b> Gabaldon sure knows how to write love, for she depicts it exactly how it is - complex and beyond the understanding of us mere mortals. Each character in print deals with this complexity of emotion.

 <b>On the show:</b> In season one’s episode <i>Castle Leoch</i>, we see Claire pack her bags and get ready to ride out. Alas! She is stopped and kept at the castle as a healer against her will.

3218,"Jamie is left-handed, at least as per the books","<b>In the books:</b> When Sam Heugen who plays Jamie Fraser emailed Gabaldon asking her about why Jamie was left-handed, she first explained the mythological aspects of the decision i.e. left-handedness was seen as a sign that demons had been at your cradle. She also mentioned how red hair was considered synonymous with the devil. So, a red-headed, left-handed person would make for a suspicious character. She also added that Jamie trained with Dougal (who himself is left-handed), thus picking up his moves. 
 <b>On the show:</b> Well, on the show, Jamie is right-handed.

3220,The show gave us a simplified version of Claire’s wedding ring,"<b>In the books:</b> Readers can testify to the fact that in the book, Jamie melts the key to make the wedding ring, but it also describes the ring as “A Highland interlace pattern, the links engraved with tiny, stylized thistle blooms.” A fancy ring fit for a fancy bride. 
 <b>On the show:</b> In season one, episode <i>The Wedding</i>, Jamie makes a ring for Claire. Symbolic of her newly achieved status as the <i>Lady of Lallybroch</i>, the red-headed Scot fashions her a ring out of the key to their home. (OMG, literal tears!) But, the ring is rather simple; the creators of the show only changed it in season four, when it gets stolen by a thief, Stephen Bonnet.",publish,Entertainment - TV & Film,Entertainment,30 Times The Outlander Show Differed from the Books,"<i>Outlander</i> began airing in 2014, and since then, has had us completely hooked.

In fact, the books go further to explain the origins of the necklace and what it meant as he clasps the pearls around Claire’s neck.

 <b>On the show:</b> While the show begins with Claire’s narration, we get a POV from Jamie in the second volume of season one, beginning with the episode <i>The Reckoning</i>.

3226,"In the books, Jamie proves that Claire is not a witch","<b>In the books:</b> Things are a tad bit different in the books. Jamie does save Claire, but instead of fighting an entire courtroom of people, he just rides in on a horse, throws a crucifix around her neck, and proves that she’s not a witch because the crucifix did not harm her.

3228,The books clearly explain why Claire chooses Jamie,"<b>In the books:</b> The texts depict Frank as a hard man and his accounts are anything but pleasing. His character is mean, chauvinistic, insensitive, and not to mention, a womanizer. So, it’s a whole lot easier for readers to sympathize with Claire when she chooses to stay with Jamie. 
 <b>On the show:</b> Frank Randall on the show is quite different from what’s shown in the books. He’s sweet, he dearly loves Claire, and looks for her for almost two years after she goes missing. Frank also has only one mistress in season three. The “good guy” Frank makes it difficult for viewers to see Claire leave him behind.
