Abagnale thought that Leo was not “suave” enough to pull off the role. Also, Abagnale was quite mature looking at quite a young age because of which he could successfully con so many people.

Daniel insisted on using his wheelchair even between takes, so much so that people had to help him with his meals during breaks.
